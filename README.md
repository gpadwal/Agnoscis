### Existing External Opportunities
[Safco Security Systems](https://www.safcosecurity.com/):
One of the services offered by Safco Security Systems (SSS) is surveillance. SSS and Agnoscis have decided to work together to offer our customers smart surveillance systems. **These video surveillance systems actively identify individuals entering private premises and determine if any of them might pose a possible threat.** An example would be individuals with known criminal backgrounds. 
Agnoscis will be presenting our machine learning services at the **World Summit AI 2021**. This Conference will be held on October 13 - 14 in Amsterdam, Netherlands.

## Item 4: Experimentation/Policies

### Experiments:
1. Initial test of using portraits and identifying them.
2. Secondary test of using group photos and identifying them
3. Tertiary test of using portraits and identifying them by relation in group photos
4. Final test of using group photos in relation to metadata and given data from text posts 

### Priorities: 
_**Initial test group will be high quality portraits to help train the algorithms.**_ Dataset needs to be trimmed and pruned, ideally erroneous data should be sanitized for ethical purposes. Can use the smaller dataset to train the next model with group photos as reference, trim and prune the newest dataset. Third test will directly compare the two trimmed datasets with their original copies for discrepancies. **This model will be used with other dataset trained to associate text post and metadata information. The final model will correlate the image data with the text data (unsure).**
